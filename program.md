## Topics and projects

TBA

collecting some ideas
- work on improving GitHub Actions which run package CI tests, e.g.
   - get rid of the `cygwin-vs` branches as outlined [here](https://github.com/gap-actions/setup-gap/issues/18#issuecomment-1322385914)
   - test against GAP releases instead of developer snapshots ([see here](https://github.com/gap-actions/setup-gap/issues/24)
